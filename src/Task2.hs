-- Usage example:
--
-- >>> listToBST compare [2,3,1]
-- Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf)
-- >>> listToBST compare ""
-- Leaf

-- | Conversion from binary search tree to list
--
-- Resulting list will be sorted

-- Usage example:
--
-- >>> bstToList (Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf))

-- >>> bstToList Leaf
-- []
--
bstToList :: Tree a -> [a]

-- | Tests whether given tree is a valid binary search tree

--
-- Usage example:
--
-- >>> isBST compare (Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf))
-- True
-- >>> isBST compare (Leaf :: Tree Char)
-- True
-- >>> isBST compare (Branch 5 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf))
-- False

-- | Searches given binary search tree for
-- given value with respect to given comparison
--
-- Returns found value (might not be the one that was given)
-- wrapped into 'Just' if it was found and 'Nothing' otherwise.
--
-- Usage example:
--
-- >>> tlookup compare 2 (Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf))
-- Just 2
-- >>> tlookup compare 'a' Leaf
-- Nothing
-- >>> tlookup (\x y -> compare (x `mod` 3) (y `mod` 3)) 5 (Branch 2 (Branch 0 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 2 Leaf Leaf))
-- Just 2

-- | Inserts given value into given binary search tree
-- preserving its BST properties with respect to given comparison
--
-- If the same value with respect to comparison
-- was already present in the 'Tree' then replaces it with given value.
--
-- Usage example:
--
-- >>> tinsert compare 0 (Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf))
-- Branch 2 (Branch 1 (Branch 0 Leaf Leaf) Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf)
-- >>> tinsert compare 1 (Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf))

-- | Deletes given value from given binary search tree
-- preserving its BST properties with respect to given comparison
--
-- Returns updated 'Tree' if the value was present in it;
-- or unchanged 'Tree' otherwise.
--
-- Usage example:
--
-- >>> tdelete compare 1 (Branch 2 (Branch 1 Leaf Leaf) (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf))
-- Branch 2 Leaf (Branch 3 Leaf Leaf)
-- >>> tdelete compare 'a' Leaf
-- Leaf
